# Source-Package-Manager
This is intended to be a package manager for LFS, pulling the source code of packages and building them.

My plans for this package manager is:
* automated package query and sourcing
* automated package dependency resolution
* automated package installation
* automated package updates
* automated log generation for package changes
* batch file installs
* other essential functions
* flags for verbose, quiet, make flags etc
* wget list support
* automatic mirror selection based on connection speed
* pleasing cli appearence
* safe LFS package updates and temporary backups
* info page with package count, pending updates, sources used, log locations, package locations etc
* easy package manager install via git, wget or curl
* easially configurable mirrorlist
