# Source-Package-Manager
This is intended to be a package manager for LFS, pulling the source code of packages and building them.

My plans for this package manager is:
* automated package query and sourcing
* automated package dependency resolution
* automated package installation
* automated package updates
* automated log generation for package changes
* batch file installs
* other essential functions
